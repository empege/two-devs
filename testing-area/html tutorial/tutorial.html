        <h2>What is HTML?</h2> 
        <p><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. A markup language is a text-encoding system which specifies the structure and formatting of a document. In layman's terms, it acts like the skeleton of a web page by telling the browser how to display the content. HTML markup consists of several components called tags. They commonly come in pairs as shown in the example below:</p>
        <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png" width="400px">
        <p>This is called an HTML Element. It consists of the opening(or start) tag, content and the closing(end tag) tag. Elements can also have attributes:</p>

        <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element, it won't appear in the actual content. They always have a space between it and the element name, followed by an equal sign and the value is wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</p>
