        <h3>Firstly, let's give a quick introduction</h3>
        <p>What is <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>?</p> 
        <p>HTML is code that's used to create and structure web pages and their content. It consists of elements, for example:</p>
        <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png" width="400px">
        <p>The element is comprised of the opening and closing tags. The content of the element is everything between the opening and closing tag. Elements can also have attributes:</p>
        <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" width="400px">
        <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element, it won't appear in the actual content. They always have a space between it and the element name, followed by an equal sign and the value is wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</p>
