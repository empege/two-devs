# ‚öÄ Two Devs ‚öÄ

Project (in the making) by two friends - Aleksandarüçº and Ivanüë©‚Äçü¶≤ - one striving to become a full fledged FE Dev, the other a medior that wants to go through the basics again and help a friend leave his shi\*\*y job so he can also experience digital suffering üôÇ.

Aleksandar will learn about HTML, CSS and JS (vanilla for now) and try to immediately teach an imaginary FE beginner through explanations in his own words and examples.

Ivan will practice setting up the project, adding important missed points and some more examples.

Hopefully this can be used in the future as reference for the two of us, but also anyone else that can find this useful.

Let's learn together and enjoy while at it! ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®

## Installation

`npm install`

Node version: `20.9.0`

## Project setup

`npm start`

We used `webpack` even though there are much better options for smaller projects like this (like Vite), but we wanted to practice using it through this as it is most widely used on bigger projects that will be worked on in the future.

For templating we used `handlebars`.

Folder `aleksandar-area` is for Aleksandar to create plain HTML, CSS, JS if needed and then bring it over to main project. Here no compilations are done, so for these files you can just open .html without starting the project and see the progress Aleksandar made before additional changes visible in the main part.
